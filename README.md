### Project Description
In this project, we are trying to replicate parts of the results from the paper "<em>Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater tracks community infection dynamics</em>". More specifically, we try to explore the optimal offsets(day lags vs day leads) that produce the highest correlation between number of cases detected in wastewater and number of cases reported by local officials.
Our finding shows that a 2,3 days lags of specimen collected date are the optimal offsets. This coincides with the 0-4 days lag since 2 and 3 are within the range.

### Dataset
The data used in the study was obtained from a Massachusettsâ€™ wastewater treatment facility with two major influent streams. The two streams are representative of ~2.25 million individuals in Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties.


### Responsibilities 

Check Point 2
* Yijian Zong integrated code from notebook and modularize them into libraries and targets
* Nick Lin developed algorithms for loss and correlation calculations, as well as visualization
* Richard Duong helped with the report description
